# optimum-car-rent-problem
A carriage company is renting cars and there is a particular car for which the interest is the highest so the company decides to book the requests one year in advance. We represent a request with a tuple (x, y) where x is the first day of the renting and y is the last. our goal is to come up with an optimum strategy where you serve the most number of requests.
